<h2 id="products">Products</h2>

<p>TRADE.com is a multi-asset brokerage firm, allowing you to access and trade the likes of Forex, commodities, bonds, indices, stocks and ETFs through CFDs.</p>

<p>There is massive depth in each of these asset classes when it comes to trading. There are more than 2,100 different assets across these categories that you are able to trade. You will have a max leverage in place of 1:300 when trading Forex. Currently, there is no cryptocurrency trading offering, which may be a negative for some people. However, you have plenty of other options to diversify otherwise.</p>

<p>To break down the asset classes a bit more, there are more than 55 currency pairs, over 25 index CFDs, a solid selection of soft and hard commodities, over 2,000 equity CFDs and a great selection of ETFs. Overall, it will be tough finding a more comprehensive investment offering than you will find with TRADE.com.</p>

<p>In terms of DMA, the firm has given clients access to literally hundreds of thousands assets through global exchanges. This service plugs investors into the markets directly via the sophisticated platform. DMA means lower fees and instant execution.</p>

<p>The Spread Betting offering is available to residents of the UK and Ireland. It brings many benefits like Tax Free Gains and is available through the TRADE.com WebTrader platform.</p>

<p>IPO is a servce offered by the brokerage firm which gives investors the ability to receive allocation to some of the leading startups before they go public. This is an amazing product and it lists some really proven firms.</p>

<p>Thematic trading is where investors can invest in a portfolio of different assets all grouped together by theme or trend.  Current portfolios include Clean Water, Cybersecurity and AI. This product is particularly well-loved as it gives investors the chance to invest in their firm beliefs and ethics.</p>

<p>The firm offers asset management services too through model portfolios and customised portfolios which are built to outperform the leading benchmarks like the S&amp;P 500.</p>

<h2 id="fees-and-charges">Fees and Charges</h2>

<p>In terms of the CFDs, the main way in which TRADE.com makes its money is through the spreads that it marks up. Naturally, these spreads are going to be different depending on what assets you are looking to trade, as well as the trading platform you are using. Taking the example of trading Forex markets through MetaTrader 4, the spread is 3 pips for EUR/USD. This is a pretty wide spread for an online broker, but there are no commissions charged by TRADE.com on trades either.</p>

<p>There are some other fees to consider also with the TRADE.com platform, such as overnight charges. swap fees for orders that remain open overnight, conversion fees for exchanging currencies, an inactivity fee if there has not been a trade made in 90 days.</p>

<p>This will be a monthly inactivity fee, rising to an annual fee as well if there has been no activity for 12 months. There are no fees charged by TRADE.com for making a deposit or a withdrawal, but do be careful as the third-party payment processor you are using may charge you fees.</p>

<p>For the other products fees vary, and it is worth speaking to the firm directly in order to understand minimum investment amounts and fees.</p>

<h2 id="trading-platforms">Trading Platforms</h2>

<p>There are two main trading platforms that you can use on TRADE.com for CFD trading. Each of them supports mobile trading, with solid mobile offerings for iOS and Android devices.</p>

This platform can be downloaded as a desktop client for Windows and Mac computers. It is a very convenient platform to use and there is an impressive selection of professional tools to use, which is why it has stood the test of time as a platform.</p>
