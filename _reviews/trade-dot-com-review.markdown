## Fees and Charges

In terms of the CFDs, the main way in which TRADE.com makes its money is through the spreads that it marks up.

Taking the example of trading Forex markets through MetaTrader 4, the spread is 3 pips for EUR/USD. This is a pretty wide spread for an online broker, but there are no commissions charged by TRADE.com on trades either. 

There are some other fees to consider also with the TRADE.com platform, such as overnight charges. swap fees for orders that remain open overnight, conversion fees for exchanging currencies, an inactivity fee if there has not been a trade made in 90 days. 

This will be a monthly inactivity fee, rising to an annual fee as well if there has been no activity for 12 months. There are no fees charged by TRADE.com for making a deposit or a withdrawal, but do be careful as the third-party payment processor you are using may charge you fees.

For the other products fees vary, and it is worth speaking to the firm directly in order to understand minimum investment amounts and fees.
